# DevOps Projects

Project ideas from beginner to advanced in DevOps

## [Log-Archive-Tool](https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool)
Build a tool to archive logs from the CLI with the date and time.

In this project, you will build a tool to archive logs on a set schedule by compressing them and storing them in a new directory, this is especially useful for removing old logs and keeping the system clean while maintaining the logs in a compressed format for future reference. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with files and directories, and building a simple cli tool.

The most common location for logs on a unix based system is /var/log.


## [Server Performance Stats](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats)

Goal of this project is to write a script to analyse server performance stats.

Requirements
You are required to write a script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

* Total CPU usage
* Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
* Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
* Top 5 processes by CPU usage
* Top 5 processes by memory usage
  
Stretch goal: Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.
