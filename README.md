## [Log-Archive-Tool](https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool)
Build a tool to archive logs from the CLI with the date and time.

In this project, you will build a tool to archive logs on a set schedule by compressing them and storing them in a new directory, this is especially useful for removing old logs and keeping the system clean while maintaining the logs in a compressed format for future reference. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with files and directories, and building a simple cli tool.

The most common location for logs on a unix based system is /var/log.
